Privacy Policy for Nodus  
Last updated: 2026-02-28  
Author: Rohin Aulakh

Nodus helps users turn article content into interactive knowledge graphs. 

Data processed:

Page content: When you click “Generate Graph,” the extension extracts readable text from the active page to create a graph.
API key: Your Gemini API key is stored locally in your browser so you do not have to re-enter it.
Generated graphs: Graph results may be cached locally per URL for faster revisits.
How data is used

Page content is sent to the Gemini API to generate the graph.
The API key is used only to authenticate those requests.
Cached graphs are stored locally and not transmitted by the extension.

What we do not collect:

We do not collect or sell personal data.
We do not collect browsing history outside of the page you explicitly process at that moment.
We do not use data for advertising.

Data storage:

The API key and cached graphs are stored locally in your browser (Chrome/Firefox storage).
We do not run servers that store your data.

Third-party services:

Google Gemini API is used to generate graph output. Page content is sent to Google only when you initiate generation.

Your choices:

You can remove the stored API key by clearing the extension’s storage.
You can uninstall the extension at any time to remove local data.

Changes to this policy:

We may update this policy. The “Last updated” date will reflect changes.
